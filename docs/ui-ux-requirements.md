UI/UX Requirements – Certificate Generator SaaS
1. Design Reference

Primary reference: Canva Web (desktop)

The product should feel immediately familiar to Canva users.

Canva is treated as a direct visual benchmark, not inspiration.

2. Core Design Principles

Creative-tool experience, not admin SaaS

Calm, premium, and professional

Visual clarity over density

Minimal cognitive load

3. Global UI Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Rounded corners across all components

Soft shadows (no harsh borders)

Layered backgrounds instead of flat white

Consistent spacing system

One unified typography scale

4. Typography System

Use a clear hierarchy:

Page Title

Section Heading

Body Text

Helper / Caption text

Avoid excessive bold text

Prefer medium and regular font weights

Consistent line-height and letter-spacing

Editor text styles must feel precise and balanced

5. Color & Visual Style

Neutral base colors

One primary accent color

Soft gradients allowed

Status colors (success, error, warning) must be subtle

Avoid aggressive or neon colors

6. Layout & Spacing

Use generous padding and margins

Group related elements into cards

Avoid dense UI blocks

Maintain visual rhythm across screens

Editor background should be neutral and calm

Toolbars must be:

Clear

Icon-friendly

Evenly spaced

Text controls must have:
